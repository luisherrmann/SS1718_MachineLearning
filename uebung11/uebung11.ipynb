    "We will now take a look at a first concrete example of a neural network, which makes use of the Python library PyTorch to learn to classify fashion articles. Unless you already have experience with PyTorch or similar libraries, you will not understand everything about this first example right away. You probably haven't even installed Pytorch yet. Don't worry, that is perfectly fine. We will do all that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we are trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of fashion articles (28 pixels by 28 pixels), into their 10 categories. The dataset we will use is the Fashion-MNIST dataset, a dropin replacement of MNIST which is a classic dataset in the machine learning community, which has been around for almost as long as the field itself and has been very intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test images. You can think of \"solving\" Fashion-MNIST or MNIST as the \"Hello World\" of deep learning --- it's what you do to verify that your algorithms are working as expected. As you become a machine learning practitioner, you will see MNIST come up over and over again, in scientific papers, blog posts, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets comes as standard datasets in PyTorch's `torchvision` library, as subclasses of `torch.utils.data.Dataset` which makes it convinent to use as we will see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our images are encoded as `PIL.Image.Image` objects, and the labels are simply an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9.  There is a one-to-one correspondence between the images and the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before training, we will transform our data by first converting it to a `Tensor` and then  normalizing it so that all image values have mean 0.5 and standard deviation of 1, by composing these operations as `transforms` function to the datasets:"
